/* The reason why I added hover, so when people hover-- they know that, 
that price is the official price that is been reduced. I also added pointer to it, 
which I already learned this all by myself. I added pointer, so when they about or going to click the price, 
that price will redirect them to the purchase or pay form. I added this to h3 specifically. without pointer, 
nothing would function properly.  */

/* the reason why I added text decoration color, 
so that it will signify people that the previous price is not included in other words a discount. 
I also tried not use too much of red because using it will overpower the screen, 
but also it will not bring back customers. 
The reason why I say that because (link: https://accessible-colors.com/) says that, 
if i am reading that correctly, 
it will not suucceed of grabbing people's attention or is going to be too strong.
I decide to use black on green that will not overpower the screen.  */
